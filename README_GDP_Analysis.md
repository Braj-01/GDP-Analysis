# GDP Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data to uncover insights about economic growth, trends, and performance across countries or regions. Using data science techniques, we aim to identify patterns and draw meaningful conclusions to support economic decision-making.

## Features
- Import and preprocess GDP datasets.
- Visualize GDP trends over time using plots and charts.
- Compare GDP growth rates between different countries/regions.
- Perform statistical analysis to identify correlations and outliers.
- 

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook/VS Code

## Data Sources
The project uses GDP datasets from reliable sources such as:
- World Bank Open Data
- IMF (International Monetary Fund)
- UN Data

## Key Insights
- [Include specific insights, e.g., "Country X experienced the highest GDP growth between 2000 and 2020."]
- [Mention key trends, e.g., "GDP growth in developing countries outpaced developed countries during the last decade."]
